To get it started, download the project and do
*python -m env venv*
To make the virtual environment.

Then activate the environment with 
*env\scripts\activate.bat*

The first time you run it, you will need to do 
*pip install -r requirements.txt*

To run, use 'snipping tool' (the native windows screenshot app) to take a picture of something on the screen. Give it a name, and put it into the project directory.
Then run 'main.py'
